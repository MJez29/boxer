# Boxer

A (wip) chrome extension that allows you to add keyword shortcuts to the chrome omnibar (big search bar at the top).

In chrome to enter Boxer mode you must type `/` followed by a tab or a space and then your keyword(s).

For example, assuming an existing alias, I could type `/ github` and then press enter to be brought to `https://github.com/MJez29`.
