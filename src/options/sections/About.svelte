  Boxer is a browser extension that lets you customize your search bar
  experience. To activate Boxer simple type
  <Code>/</Code>
  in your search bar followed by a space or a tab. For Boxer to be of assistance
  you must first define aliases. An alias is a mapping from a series of
  keywords, for example "google maps", to a url, "https://maps.google.com".
