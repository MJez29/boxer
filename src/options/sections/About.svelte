<p>
  Boxer is a browser extension that lets you customize your search bar
  experience. To activate Boxer simple type
  <Code>/</Code>
  in your search bar followed by a space or a tab. For Boxer to be of assistance
  you must first define aliases. An alias is a mapping from a series of
  keywords, for example "google maps", to a url, "https://maps.google.com".
</p>

<Header>Adding an Alias</Header>
<p>
  To add an alias simply navigate to the Aliases page and enter a name and link
  for your alias in the empty row. Once you are satisfied with your alias press
  the checkmark to save!

<Header>Activating Boxer in the Search Bar</Header>
<p>
  In the search bar enter a forward slash (
  <Code>/</Code>
  ) followed by either the tab key or the space key. This activates Boxer. Now
  start typing the name of the alias you creating in the last section, it should
  appear as the first search result. You can choose it by clicking on it, by
  tabbing down to it and pressing enter, or by clicking enter and having Boxer
  take you to the link that best matches your input (in this case it should be
  your alias).
